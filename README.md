## Working with the script.

#### Technologies used in the development: 

:white_check_mark: [Python's csv module](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/csv.html#module-csv)

If you wish to work with the files created for the front end code, you'll need to clone the repository first.

- Cloning Repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Erick-WG/Text-To-CSV.git
```

At this point you need to `navigate to the same level as the main.py file`, let your `input file` be located here so the script reads from it, the `output file` will be generated on the fly.

Run the script and that's it, congratulations on your build ðŸ˜‚ðŸ”¥
